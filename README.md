# Horiseon-Marketing-Agency
A semantic HTML and CSS framework for a marketing website featuring SEO, Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing

## Description

In this Project, our goal is to improve the accessibility and code quality of an existing website. Accessibility is a vital aspect of web development, ensuring that everyone, including individuals with disabilities, can access and use a website effectively. This not only enhances user experience but also has broader implications, such as better search engine optimization and compliance with accessibility standards.

## Introduction

The marketing agency has assigned us the task of making an existing website more accessible. Our objective is to ensure that the website meets accessibility standards and best practices. This not only fulfills our client's needs but also contributes to the website's long-term sustainability.

## Project Details

- **User Story:** As a marketing agency, we want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

## Accessibility Improvements

To meet the accessibility standards, we have addressed the following criteria:

1. **Semantic HTML Elements:** We have replaced or updated HTML elements with semantic HTML elements, improving the structural understanding of the page by both browsers and screen readers.

2. **Logical Structure:** We have ensured that the HTML structure remains logical and independent of styling and positioning, reflecting the natural reading order of the content.

3. **Alt Attributes for Images and Icons:** We've added or updated the `alt` attribute for all images and icons, providing concise and meaningful descriptions.

4. **Sequential Headings:** We've arranged heading elements (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.) in a logical and sequential order, ensuring consistent hierarchy.

5. **Concise and Descriptive Title:** We've updated the `<title>` element to provide a concise and descriptive title for the webpage, reflecting its content and purpose.

## Code Refactoring

In addition to accessibility improvements, we've gone the extra mile by reworking the CSS. We've:

- Consolidated CSS selectors and properties for better efficiency.
- Organized CSS to follow the semantic structure of HTML elements.
- Included comments before each element or section of the page to explain their purpose.
